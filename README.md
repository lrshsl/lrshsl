### Hi there :)

I'm just someone who's interested in basically everything about programming and computers. I'm especially fascinated by *notation*, i. e. any kind of language, alphabet and grammar, be it for programming languages, natural languages, maths notation or other DSLs.

#### What I can do

##### Programming Languages
[![Most used languages](https://lrshsl-github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=lrshsl&hide=jupyter-notebook&langs_count=5&theme=chartreuse-dark)]()

Since the above graph isn't really representive for my language skills and preferences, I created my own language ranking. The numbers can (generally) be read like "per cent of the language that I know", or maybe better just in relation to each other.

| Python | Rust | Java | Javascript / Typescript | C  | Lua | Shell | C++ | PHP | Assembly | APL |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ----------------------- | -- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | -------- | --- |
| 90     | 80   | 60   | 60                      | 60 | 50  | 45    | 40  | 30  | 10       | 8   |

Others:

| HTML / CSS | SQL | Markdown | Latex | Vimscript | Makefile |
| ---------- | --- | -------- | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| 60         | 60  | 80       | 30    | 3         | 70       |

I'd say I'm *proficient* in Python, *intermediate* in Rust, and *get along* with almost everything else that is considered "mainstream". As one can see, very wide ranging interests, not much focus..

#### What I want to learn

I'm interested in many areas of software development. What I'd like to know more about, or spend more time doing:

- Low-level systems, embedded (C, Zig, Nim)
- Functional programming (Haskell, Elixir)
- Web
  - Get experience with JS frameworks
  - Cyber security, hacking
- More Rust :)
- More exotic languages, such as APL or Assembler

#### What I want to do

- Languages:
  - Markup language that combines Markdown and Latex with styling. Could compile to HTML maybe
  - Assembly language that isn't specific to an architecture with some nice-looking syntax (I know won't be very useful, but for education purposes maybe?)
  - General purpose language with compiler built with LLVM
- Text editor for myself
- Youtube channel?
